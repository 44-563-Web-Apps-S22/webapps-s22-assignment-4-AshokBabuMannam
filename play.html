            <p>
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="stagedirection">What, dear Élise!</p> 
            <p class="speech">you grow sad after having given me such dear
            tokens of your love; and I see you sigh in the midst of my joy! Can
            you regret having made me happy? and do you repent of the engagement
            which my love has forced from you?</p>

            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5>
            <p class="stagedirection">No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you;</p>
            <p class="speech">I feel carried on
            by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should
            be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very
            anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you
            more than I should.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family,
            the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your
            heart! I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays
            the too warm proofs of an innocent love.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think
            me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe
            to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting
            as my life!</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Ah! Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in
            their words; their actions only show the difference that exists
            between them.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of
            the truthfulness of my heart? Do not suffer your anxious fears to
            mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy
            the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to
            show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those
            we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly
            incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you
            will ever remain faithful to me. I will no longer doubt that happiness
            is near. If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our
            position, and the possible censures of the world.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">But why even this fear?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Oh, Valère! if everybody knew you as I do, I should not have much
            to fear. I find in you enough to justify all I do for you; my heart
            knows all your merit, and feels, moreover, bound to you by deep
            gratitude. How can I forget that horrible moment when we met for the
            first time? Your generous courage in risking your own life to save
            mine from the fury of the waves; your tender care afterwards; your
            constant attentions and your ardent love, which neither time nor
            difficulties can lessen! For me you neglect your parents and your
            country; you give up your own position in life to be a servant of my
            father! How can I resist the influence that all this has over me? Is
            it not enough to justify in my eyes my engagement to you? Yet, who
            knows if it will be enough to justify it in the eyes of others? and
            how can I feel sure that my motives will be understood?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">You try in vain to find merit in what I have done; it is by my
            love alone that I trust to deserve you. As for the scruples you feel,
            your father himself justifies you but too much before the world; and
            his avarice and the distant way in which he lives with his children
            might authorise stranger things still. Forgive me, my dear Élise, for
            speaking thus of your father before you; but you know that,
            unfortunately, on this subject no good can be said of him. However, if
            I can find my parents, as I fully hope I shall, they will soon be
            favourable to us. I am expecting news of them with great impatience;
            but if none comes I will go in search of them myself.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">Oh no! Valère, do not leave me, I entreat you. Try rather to
            ingratiate yourself in my father's favour.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">You know how much I wish it, and you can see how I set about it.
            You know the skilful manoeuvres I have had to use in order to
            introduce myself into his service; under what a mask of sympathy and
            conformity of tastes I disguise my own feelings to please him; and
            what a part I play to acquire his affection. I succeed wonderfully
            well, and I feel that to obtain favour with men, there are no better
            means than to pretend to be of their way of thinking, to fall in with
            their maxims, to praise their defects, and to applaud all their
            doings. One need not fear to overdo it, for however gross the
            flattery, the most cunning are easily duped; there is nothing so
            impertinent or ridiculous which they will not believe, provided it be
            well seasoned with praise. Honesty suffers, I acknowledge; but when we
            have need of men, we may be allowed without blame to adapt ourselves
            to their mode of thought; and if we have no other hope of success but
            through such stratagem, it is not after all the fault of those who
            flatter, but the fault of those who wish to be flattered.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ELI">ELI.</h5>
            <p class="speech">Why do you not try also to gain my brother's goodwill, in case
            the servant should betray our secret?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5> 
            <p class="speech">I am afraid I cannot humour them both. The temper of the father
            is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be
            the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother
            yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him
            in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound
            him, and see how far we can trust him.</p>
