        <p class="stagedirection">Why do you not try also to gain my brother's goodwill,</p> 
        <p class="speech">in case the servant should betray our secret?</p>

        <h5 class="name VAL">VAL.</h5>
        <p class="stagedirection">I am afraid I cannot humour them both.</p> 
        <p class="speech">The temper of the father
        is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be
        the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother
        yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him
        in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound
        him, and see how far we can trust him.</p>

        <h5 class="name VAL">ELI.</h5>
        <p class="stagedirection">I greatly fear</p> 
        <p class="speech">I shall never have the courage to speak to him of my secret</p>
